Use case: We have to create a broadcast channel.
It keeps track of all the objects listening to it and anytime a new piece of data comes along it sends a message to each listener.
What's cool is that the listeners can join broadcast at any time or they can even remove themselves.
It is really dynamic and loosely coupled.
